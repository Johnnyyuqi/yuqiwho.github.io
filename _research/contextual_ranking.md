Generating high-quality word and sentence representations is a foundational task in natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, various embedding methodologies have been proposed, notably those leveraging the capabilities of large language models for in-context learning. Research has shown that language model performance can be enhanced by integrating a query with multiple examples. Inspired by this research, this project explores the use of a contrastive learning framework combined with ranking knowledge to enhance the generation and retrieval of sentence embeddings, aiming to more accurately identify the most similar sentences in in-context learning scenarios.

Thus, after investigating the theory of object detection algorithms, spiking neural network and spiking camera, I built the spiking dataset based on the large-scale dataset COCO2017, PASCAL VOC and the tiny-scale dataset which made by myself. Also, I utilized the ANN to SNN transformation algorithm to transform the tailored tiny-yolo into the spiking neural network. After that, I improved the networkâ€™s performance with the optimizations such as channel normalization and robust normalization. As a result, the spiking neural network attains a similar performance with one-tenth energy consumption compared to the artificial neural network.
